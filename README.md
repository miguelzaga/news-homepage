## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned to use interpolation in Sass:

```scss
  &__navbar {
    background: #{$dark-space-blue}80;
    }
```

### Continued development

I need to learn more about Sass.

### Useful resources

- [How to Load and Use Custom Fonts with CSS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-load-and-use-custom-fonts-with-css) - It helped me load the given fonts.
- [Working with Strings in Sass](https://vanseodesign.com/css/sass-strings/) - I did the background of the mobile menu using Sass interpolation, to avoid writing down the hex code, adding the opacity code at the en of the color variable.
- [Button click pulsing effect - Pure CSS](https://codepen.io/ash_s_west/pen/GRZbvym) - I based the anchor and buttons active state on this effect.
